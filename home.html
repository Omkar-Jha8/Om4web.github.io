                <P>
                    Penguins are flightless seabirds that live almost exclusively below the equator. Some
                    island-dwellers can be found in warmer climates, but most—including emperor, adélie, chinstrap, and
                    gentoo penguins—reside in and around icy Antarctica. A thick <a

                <P>
                    The koala is an iconic Australian animal. Often called the koala “bear,” this tree-climbing animal
                    is a marsupial—a mammal with a pouch for the development of offspring. Though koalas look fuzzy,
                    their hair is more like the coarse wool of a sheep. They have <a

                <P>
                    Jellyfish have drifted along on ocean currents for millions of years, even before dinosaurs lived on the Earth. The jellylike creatures pulse along on ocean currents and are abundant in cold and warm ocean water, in deep water, and along coastlines.

                <P>
                    African lions have been admired throughout history for as symbols of courage and strength. These iconic animals have powerful bodies—in the cat family, they’re second in size only to tigers—and roars that can be heard from five miles away.
